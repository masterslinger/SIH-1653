## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

Interview Structure Design The interview process should begin with ice-breaking questions and then proceed to in-depth technical and managerial questions that align with the applicant's domain of expertise. To facilitate this, the interview system could be structured as follows:
a. Ice-breaking Questions (Optional) Purpose: Make the candidate feel comfortable and set the tone for the interview. Example Questions: Tell us about yourself and your journey in the field. What motivates you in your work? How do you stay updated with the latest trends in your field? b. Technical Questions Purpose: Evaluate the depth of knowledge in the candidate's specialized area. The system will need a knowledge database specific to DRDO's scientific and technological fields (e.g., Aerospace, Defence Electronics, Robotics, Materials, etc.). Each question must be tailored to the candidate's background and the advertised vacancy, avoiding generic questions. c. Managerial Questions (for senior-level candidates) Purpose: Evaluate leadership, project management, and problem-solving skills. Example: How do you manage a team to meet tight deadlines in high-pressure environments? Describe a challenging project and how you handled it. d. Evaluation Metrics for Questions Each question should be assigned a relevancy score based on:

Expert Domain Relevancy: How well the question fits the specific domain of the candidate. Depth of Knowledge: The level of technical complexity that is appropriate for the position. Role Fit: The extent to which the question is suitable for the advertised role (scientific, managerial, etc.). 2. AI-Powered Interview Assistant An AI assistant will play a significant role in this process by generating questions, ensuring relevancy, and evaluating responses. The system could utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to achieve the following:

a. Question Generation The AI system will be able to generate questions based on the candidate's background, previous experience, and the requirements of the advertised post. It can propose a variety of questions across different difficulty levels, ensuring that the right questions are asked at the right stage of the interview. b. Relevancy Scoring For each question asked, the AI system will score the relevancy of the question against the candidate's expertise using a semantic similarity algorithm. The AI will evaluate the question’s alignment with the candidate's resume and domain expertise (using resume parsing and NLP-based domain classification). The system will assign scores based on how specific and relevant the question is to the candidate’s expertise. c. Response Evaluation The AI system will also evaluate the candidate’s responses, scoring them based on their relevancy, completeness, and clarity. Using NLP, the system will analyze the response to see if it addresses the question fully. The quality of the response will be scored based on keywords, depth of knowledge, logical reasoning, and completeness. d. Scoring System Each question will have a relevancy score assigned (0-10). Responses will be graded on a scale based on relevance, depth, and clarity (0-10). A final overall score will be generated by aggregating the scores of both questions and responses, contributing to an objective final assessment of the candidate’s suitability for the position. 3. Expert Evaluation To maintain human judgment in the process, a panel of experts will be involved in the final evaluation. The system will help experts by:

Providing Real-Time Insights: The AI will provide experts with real-time feedback on the candidate's performance. Assisting with Scoring: Experts can adjust or validate AI-generated scores, providing their insights on specific areas where the candidate's response might require more nuance. 4. Candidate Experience The system will also simulate a real-life boardroom experience:

Interactive Video Interface: The system can facilitate video-based interviews, where candidates can interact with a virtual or human panel of experts. Dynamic Question Flow: Based on responses, the AI system will adjust the line of questioning, asking follow-up questions as necessary to dig deeper into the candidate's expertise. Feedback Mechanism: After the interview, candidates will receive feedback based on their performance, along with insights on areas of improvement. 5. Implementation Details a. Technology Stack AI/ML Technologies: NLP models (like GPT, BERT, etc.) to analyze responses and generate questions. Database: A robust question bank tailored to DRDO’s scientific domains, integrated with candidate data. Video Conferencing Tools: Integration with video platforms for live interviews. Scoring Algorithms: Predefined algorithms for relevancy and response analysis. b. Candidate Database Create a candidate database that stores information related to candidate skills, past experiences, and preferences. This will help the system tailor questions according to the specific role they are applying for. c. Security and Privacy Ensure that all candidate data and interview responses are stored securely and in compliance with privacy regulations, particularly with sensitive information like scientific and defense-related knowledge.
